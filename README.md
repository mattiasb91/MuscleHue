# MuscleHue

Welcome to my app MuscleHue! a small solo project where the goal was to create an app that keeps track of your muscles' recovery by showing an anatomical model with colored muscles.

in the UI you log workouts from the dropdown menu to the right. Each workout has a set of muscles tied to it. when you've logged the muscles affected will be updated with a new color, signaling that they've just been worked out. As the days go by the colors will shift towards recovering, and then fully recovered. Try it out! 



## Backend:

The backend uses express and mongodb with mongoose.

## Frontend:

The frontend uses React with vite, and vite plugin vsgr to incorporate vsg-images into the code.
